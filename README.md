A helper package to get information of scholarly articles from [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) using its public API.

## Usage

```python
import dblp
import pandas as pd

queries: list[str] = [...]

results: pd.DataFrame = dblp.search(queries)
results_with_ccf_class: pd.DataFrame = dblp.add_ccf_class(results)
```

## Examples

### Get Search Results

```python
import dblp

queries = [
    'Anomaly Detection in Streams with Extreme Value Theory',
    'Intelligent Detection of Large-Scale KPI Streams Anomaly Based on Transfer Learning',
    'Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Variational Auto-Encoder for Seasonal KPIs in Web Applications',
    'Robust and Unsupervised KPI Anomaly Detection Based on Conditional Variational Autoencoder',
    'Advances in Cryptography and Secure Hardware for Data Outsourcing',
]

results = dblp.search(queries)
```

The results will be:

```python
[
